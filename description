Description

for my cloud computing project i chose to host wrodpress in azure, and using bicep i was able to automate it. i used PAAS for my project. using the CLI command line in azure i was able to use the IAC code for bicep installation. at first i manually build the project using azure MySQL database and MySQL workbench. using MySQL workbench i was able to link my azure MySQL database to my app service in azure portal. after i built it manually and it all confimred worked to make a wordpress site i decidedn that it is now time for automation to happen


Well architected framework

keeping to the well architected framwork was difficult, it was definitely something that i kept in the back of my mind towards the end of the project in order to meet
the goals of the framework. i changed the kind of servers that i was running on to keep the cost down because as is i was blowing through the class budget rather quickly.
the suggested size of server that azure says is not what you should use. reliability is quite good because it is automated with my script and it has worked everytime after i 
fixed some things. it is based on all platforms that are widely used and are not known for much if any downtime on the regular. if there is to be downtime on wordpress it tells
you that there is maintainance to be done and the site needs to be restarted to make those changes so downtime can be scheduled around that. security is great because it is all built into SQL and azure. microsoft is very secure and take the privacy
of user seriously. performance is not great because its all ran on one channel and it is not going to be great if there is alot of traffic, a bigger server is needed.
